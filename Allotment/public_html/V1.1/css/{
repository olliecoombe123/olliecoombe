<p>If you have a CCJ (County Court Judgement) against you, this information is on the public record and will show on your credit report for 6 years. Lenders can see this as a negative, however they pay less attention the older the record is. 
<p>
<p>
If you do have a CCJ, make sure you comply with any rules or restrictions you are given. Once your CCJ is paid and your debt is back under control, using a credit builder card very carefully can help you rebuild your credit score. 
<p>
<p>
It’s worth noting that the financial accounts which were involved in your CCJ may still show on your credit report after you settle the CCJ, as this indicates that they were once in default/arrears.
<h1>What to do if you have an incorrect CCJ showing</h1>
A CCJ will stay on your report for 6 years, even if you have paid it off. However, you can apply to the court for a ‘certificate of satisfaction’. This means the CCJ will show on the public register as ‘satisfied’. This might make it easier to apply for credit before the CCJ drops off your credit report. 
<p>
<p>
If you think you have a CCJ incorrectly showing on your report, you can contact the court involved for further details. Alternatively, you can raise a dispute so that Equifax can look into this for you. Equifax is the credit reference agency who we partner with to give you access to your report, so any change to your report will be made by them.",

		<p>
		When you miss several payments on an account, the account goes into default. Or, if it’s a secured loan such as a mortgage, your property can be repossessed. Even if the default is settled/paid up now, this information stays on your report for 6 years. Lenders can see this as a negative, but pay less attention the older the record is.
		<p>
		If you have defaulted on an account, the best thing to do is to set up a repayment plan and avoid borrowing any more until your debt is more manageable. Once your debt is under control, you could try using a credit builder card to carefully rebuild your credit score. By setting up direct debits to pay all your bills, you can avoid missing any more payments. 
		<h1>How to find defaults on your report</h1>
		<p>
		Start by looking through your “Accounts” tab and the payment history for each account. You should be able to see any missed payments, or if the account was ever marked in default.
 		<p>
		If you can’t see it here, click on the “Closed” tab and look through all of the closed accounts on your report. 
 		<h1>What to do if you have incorrect defaults showing</h1>
		If your accounts are incorrectly showing as being defaulted, first speak to the company directly as they may be able to provide further information. You can also raise a dispute so that Equifax can look into this for you. Equifax is the credit reference agency who we partner with to give you access to your report, so any change to your report will be made by them.

 		<li> You’ve registered on the electoral roll in the last 4-6 weeks, and it isn’t showing yet</li>

		<li>Your address on ClearScore is in a different format to your address on the electoral roll. In this case the answer is a bit fiddly. Please contact us and we can help you.</li>
